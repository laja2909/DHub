# change name of the project
# finish documents
# toml file


#DONE:
# Create TFCloud class and think about the functions and attributes there
# Create docs md of the remote connection
# Create proper key files and make sure to save them in proper folder (do it in separate py file)
# check that you have remote access now
# create manage_tf_cloud.py

#NOTES:
## You need to have correct indentityfile to access remotely in ssh:
---example this creates a connection: ssh root@159.69.35.153 -i .ssh-tf-hetzner-cloud/id_rsa.key
---and then in .ssh config file replace the identity file attribute with correct absolute path
